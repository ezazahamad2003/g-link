# g-link

## About The Project

g-link is a research project focused on generating novel insights by integrating knowledge graphs from disparate scientific domains. This project specifically explores the intersection of **physics** and **biology**, aiming to uncover new knowledge by forming connections between their respective knowledge graphs.

## Methodology

The core methodology involves:
1.  **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Developing or utilizing existing knowledge graphs for the domains of physics and biology.
2.  **Inter-Domain Linking with GNNs:** Employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify and create new nodes or edges that bridge these two distinct knowledge graphs.
3.  **Knowledge Discovery via Reasoning:** Utilizing a reasoning model to analyze the augmented, interconnected graph structure to discover emergent knowledge and novel relationships.

## Goals

-   To develop a framework for integrating knowledge graphs from different domains.
-   To leverage GNNs for identifying potential cross-domain links.
-   To apply reasoning models to extract new, previously unrecognised knowledge from the combined graph.
-   To demonstrate the potential of this approach by finding new connections between physics and biology.
